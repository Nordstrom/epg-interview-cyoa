# Choose Your Own Adventure Interview Assignment

## Description

We'd like you to show us what you have!  Your task is to implement "something" for us to review.  Be ready to describe what you implemented and why you thought it would be interesting to show.  The implementation should fall in to one of the following categories:

* System Automation
* System Administration
* Application Development

## Existing Projects

As long as you have contributed to or maintain an open source project that meets the
requirements below, we'd love to see it.  Ideally this is something
you have written recently and will be able to speak to in depth.

## Rules:

* Clone this repo to your github account.
* You have to push the code on your Github account and make a pull
  request to with the results.
* You must include a README that summarizes the problem being solved and what "user stories" were implemented
* It must be repeatable, that is something that we can see in action
* Be creative!  Have fun!

**IF YOU CAN'T USE A PUBLIC REPO ON GITHUB, USE BITCUCKET [[ https://bitbucket.org/ ]] AND SET UP A PRIVATE REPO**
